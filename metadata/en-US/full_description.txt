<b>About</b>
Over time I've used several apps to store my PINs, unfortunately none of them really convinced me.
So here we are now, this is my own implementation of a secure PIN manager.

If you think it's worth to support this project, feel free to give a small donation ❤️ (<a href="https://github.com/cyb3rko/pincredible#donate">Donate</a>).

The app obfuscates the PIN in a table layout surrounded by secure random numbers.
This brings two security benefits:
1. ❔ The app can not know where in the pattern the user given PIN is located at. Attackers can not extract the plaintext PIN.
2. 🕵️ This offers protection against <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoulder_surfing_(computer_security)" title="shoulder surfing">Shoulder Surfing</a>, for example while accessing your PIN in a super market or a bank.
